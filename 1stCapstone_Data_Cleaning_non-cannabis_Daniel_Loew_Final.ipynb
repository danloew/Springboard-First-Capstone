This notebook specifically prepares a random sample of crimes that are not specifically cannabis-related, of equivalent size to the universe of cannabis crimes prepared in the '1st_Capstone_Data_Cleaning_cannabis_Daniel_Loew_Final' notebook.  This sample of \"non-cannabis crimes\" will be concatenated with the universe of cannabis crimes to help identify the primary features that differentiate cannabis crimes from all other crimes in New York City between 2006 and 2018. The  classification models created later in the project will provide a comprehensive image of the coefficients of cannabis arrests within the bounds of the dataset provided by the NYPD."

    "The following section uses boolean masks and feature assignment to create new binary features for major holidays that always fall on the same day of the year. These holidays could be predictors of cannabis crimes because different holidays have special meaning to demographic groups that may be differentially targeted for cannabis arrests, and more generally holidays are drivers of behavior in the United States. These major holidays are New Year's Day, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, July 4th, Halloween, Christmas Eve, Christmas, and New Year's Eve. April 20th is included as it is an emerging day of cannabis celebrations and could be relevant. Intriguingly, this day has more cannabis arrests than any holiday.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by first creating a DataFrame with the month and day of each fixed holiday. Then, the contents of the DataFrame are used by 'for' loops to create individual features storing whether a crime occurred on that particular fixed holiday or not. Fixed holiday features are then cast into integer type, and their values are called."

    "There looks to be several outlier cases with Latitudes and Longitudes outside of the boundaries of New York City that need to be removed before a proper scatterplot can be run. The boundaries of New York City range from 40.495992 through 40.915568 Latitude North and -74.257159 through -73.699215 Longitude West (https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/open-data/nybb_metadata.pdf?ver=19d). For situations where a significant proportion of cases are geographic outliers, their latitude/longitude values would be trimmed to the maximum or minimum point of the range, whichever is nearest. However, because of the vanishingly small proportion of outliers (129 out of 6,238,620 cases), removing these cases will not bias the results. \n",

    "The outliers are identified by first defining a Boolean mask Series called 'lat_lon_keeper' for cases where the Latitude and Longitude are within this range. Next, a new integer type feature named 'lat_lon_keeper' is created in the 'nyc_non_cann' DataFrame by assigning the Boolean mask Series 'lat_lon_keeper' to it, assigning values of '1' for the keepers and '0' for the outliers."

Driving/walking/biking distances, or 'L1' features, are computed. Shortest distances (\"as the crow flies\"), or 'L2' features, are also computed. This is done by creating a DataFrame with latitudes and longitudes for each NYC landmark, which is transposed for ease of use in two 'for' loops executed below. These 'for' loops create individual features storing the distance of each crime from each of the landmarks, both for 'L1' and 'L2' distances. The longitude is programmatically assigned a negative value because NYC has negative longitude as it is west of the Prime Meridian."
