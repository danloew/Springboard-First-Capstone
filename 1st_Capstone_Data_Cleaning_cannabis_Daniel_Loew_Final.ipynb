    "As has been reported (Levine, 2017; Harcourt & Ludwig, 2006; Mueller, Gebeloff, & Chinoy, 2018), data on low-level cannabis possession arrests in New York City have shown that they have been predominantly of young African-American and Latino men since at least 1987. Given the history of the drug war under Presidents Nixon, Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton, and Bush Jr., and initially under Harry Anslinger during his years as the first Commissioner of the U.S. Treasury Department's Federal Bureau of Narcotics during the Jazz Age, this racial disparity of low-level cannabis arrests has likely remained constant since the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 passed, which effectively made the plant illegal. However, data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services shows consistently that people of different racial groups use cannabis at effectively the same rate (SAMHSA, 2016). This is an issue of extreme concern for human and civil rights groups, as it allows discrimination in criminal justice under the guise of public health concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This racial disparity in cannabis arrests continues to this day through the mayoral transition to Mayor DeBlasio from Mayor Bloomberg's policy era of stop-and-frisk arrests, even while cannabis arrests have dropped since their height around 2011 (Levine). At the same time, overall crime has dropped in New York City (Mueller, Gebeloff, & Chinoy, 2018). The New York Police Department (NYPD) has been pressed to explain this disparity, and has responded by saying that it is due to the fact that they receive more cannabis-related complaints from neighborhoods which are predominantly occupied by African-American and Latino residents. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The New York Times has done an analysis exploring this claim, and has shown that even between neighborhoods that have the same level of cannabis-related complaints, more cannabis arrests occur in neighborhoods with a majority of African-American and Latino residents (Mueller, Gebeloff, & Chinoy, 2018). One explanation for the racial disparity is that these neighborhoods are often more policed because of a higher rate of violent crimes there. Another explanation is that when people are arrested for cannabis, NYPD officers are able to check for open warrants and are therefore a way for police officers to cut down on other types of crime through these arrests. But these explanations do not fully illustrate the reasons that this racial disparity in low-level cannabis arrests persist during an era of criminal justice reform, given the data available. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While looking at both low-level and more serious cannabis arrests including felony sales, this report aims to provide a more complete picture of the predictors that influence cannabis arrests in New York City. In order to do so, machine learning classification methods will be applied to predict the following five target features: misdemeanor cannabis possession, violation cannabis possession, felony cannabis possession, misdemeanor cannabis sales, and felony cannabis sales. Additionally, these methods will be used to predict possession arrests vs. sales arrests. Violation sales were not used as a target feature as violation sales of cannabis are not a legal category.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification methods will also be used to try and differentiate predictors of cannabis crimes from non-cannabis crimes; in other words, all other crimes. This will be done using all cannabis crimes and a set of non-cannabis crimes of the same size randomly selected from the larger pool of non-cannabis crimes. By using machine learning methods to discover the features with the largest coefficients within classification models, the identification of biases in the most scientific sense of the term can be identified for future research and analysis by criminologists, human rights groups, legal scholars, public policy researchers, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods will be used on all crimes between January 1st, 2006 and December 31st, 2018 in New York City as reported by the NYPD's Complaint Data historic dataset. A set of features from the original dataset and a set of features derived from this data will be used to create classification models that will attempt to identify several salient predictors of cannabis arrests in New York City during modern times. It is important to note that the data cleaning protocols and classification models developed in this project can also be modified to investigate the predictive factors of any type of crime that occurs in New York City. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully this project will present a fuller image of cannabis arrests that can be used to inform and improve drug policy in New York City and in the rest of the country, so that the suffering caused by Drug War policies can be reduced."

These holidays could be predictors of cannabis crimes because different holidays have special meaning to demographic groups that may be differentially targeted for cannabis arrests, and more generally holidays are drivers of behavior in the United States. These major holidays are New Year's Day, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, July 4th, Halloween, Christmas Eve, Christmas, and New Year's Eve. April 20th is included as it is an emerging day of cannabis celebrations and could be relevant. Intriguingly, this day has more cannabis arrests than any holiday.\n",

Then, the contents of the DataFrame are used by 'for' loops to create individual features storing whether a crime occurred on that particular fixed holiday or not. Fixed holiday features are then cast into integer type, and their values are called."

    "There looks to be an outlier case with Latitude outside of the boundaries of New York City that needs to be removed before a proper scatterplot can be run, as this project focuses on crimes within New York City. For situations where a significant proportion of cases are  geographic outliers, their latitude/longitude values would be trimmed to the maximum or minimum point of the range, whichever is nearest. However, because the outlier constitutes a vanishingly small proportion of the total cannabis crimes, removing this case will not bias the results. The outlier is identified by first defining a Boolean mask Series called 'lat_outlier' for cases where the Latitude is greater than 48, as the outlier can visually be identified as having a Latitude greater than 48. Next, a new integer type feature named 'lat_outlier' is created in the 'nyc_cann' DataFrame by assigning the Boolean mask Series 'lat_outlier' to it, assigning vales of '1' for the outlier and '0' for the rest of the cases."

Driving/walking/biking distance, or 'L1', features, are computed. Shortest distance (\"as the crow flies\"), or 'L2', features are also computed. This is done by creating a DataFrame with latitudes and longitudes for each NYC landmark, which is transposed for ease of use in two 'for' loops executed below. These 'for' loops create individual features storing the distance of each crime from each of the landmarks, both for 'L1' and 'L2' distances. The longitude is programmatically assigned a negative value because NYC has negative longitude as it is west of the Prime Meridian."

These include 'misdemeanor', 'violation', and 'felony'. 'Possession' is kept as the target feature for classification models differentiating cannabis possession crimes from cannabis sales crimes, which will be explored with a second round of classification. However, 'sales' is not needed, so it is dropped as well.
