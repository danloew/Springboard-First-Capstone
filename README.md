# Springboard-First-Capstone
Full Code, Report, and Slide Deck for Daniel Loew's First Springboard Capstone Project

Title: "Targets: Using Machine Learning Classification Models to Identify Salient Predictors of Cannabis Arrests in New York City, 2006-2018"

The 11 Jupyter notebooks that are needed to run the project are located at the following links:
  - Data Cleaning for Cannabis Crimes: https://github.com/danloew/Springboard-First-Capstone/blob/master/1st_Capstone_Data_Cleaning_cannabis_Daniel_Loew_Final.ipynb
    -The file name is '1st_Capstone_Data_Cleaning_cannabis_Daniel_Loew_Final.ipynb'.
    -This notebook uses the original open-source dataset of all crimes in New York City, which is available on the NYC Open 
     Data Project at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i
    -It also uses a file of all NYC subway entrances, available at the following link: https://data.ny.gov/widgets/i9wp-a4ja
    -This notebook generates the 'nyc_cann_for_EDA.csv' and 'nyc_cann_EDA_race_reported.csv' files, which are used in the Data      Story & EDA Jupyter notebook.
    -This notebook also generates the 'nyc_cann_HT_sample.csv' file, for use in the Statistical Data Analysis notebook.
    -This notebook also generates the 'nyc_cann_ml_alt.csv' file, for use in the second through seventh Machine Learning      
     Jupyter notebooks.
    -This notebook also generates the 'nyc_cann_for_ML.csv' file, for use in the Data Cleaning for Non-Cannabis Crimes Jupyter 
    notebook.
    
  - Data Cleaning for Non-Cannabis Crimes: https://github.com/danloew/Springboard-First-Capstone/blob/master/1stCapstone_Data_Cleaning_non-cannabis_Daniel_Loew_Final.ipynb
    -The file name is '1stCapstone_Data_Cleaning_non-cannabis_Daniel_Loew_Final.ipynb'.
    -This notebook uses the original open-source dataset of all crimes in New York City, which is available on the NYC Open 
     Data Project at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i
    -It also uses a file of all NYC subway entrances, available at the following link: https://data.ny.gov/widgets/i9wp-a4ja 
    -This notebook generates the 'nyc_non_cann_HT_sample.csv' file, for use in the Statistical Data Analysis notebook.
    -This notebook also generates the 'nyc_non_cann_for_ML.csv' file, and concatenates it with the 'nyc_cann_ml_alt.csv' file,      which is then exported to the 'concat_cann_non_cann_for_ml.csv' fie for use in the first Machine Learning Jupyter   
     notebook.

- The URL detailing the NYPD's police precincts, which is used throughout the project, is located here: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/bureaus/patrol/precincts-landing.page
- The URL detailing the NYC transit districts, which is used throughout the project, is located here: www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/bureaus/transit-housing/transit.page
- The file called "requirements.rtf" details all of the software requirements needed to run the Jupyter notebooks. This file is divided into a section for each of the 11 Jupyter notebooks.
- Reports: names and links to them
- Slide Deck: name and link on Google Docs
- instruction on how to repeat your code
- very brief synopsis of results: reference to reports and section names, most likely. writing anything up here would be too much, I think
